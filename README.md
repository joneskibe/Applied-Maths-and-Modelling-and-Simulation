Bouncing ball mathematical model

Assumptions
To simplify the model:
•	The ball is dropped vertically in 1D motion (only height h(t) varies).
•	No air resistance.
•	All impacts occur on a rigid, flat surface (ground).
•	Deformation during collision is instantaneous.
•	The ball behaves as a point mass.
•	Gravity is constant: g=9.81 m/s2
•	Initial drop from rest: v0=0
